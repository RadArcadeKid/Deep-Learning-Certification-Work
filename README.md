# Deep-Learning-Certification-Work
Currently taking Andrew NG's Deep Learning specialization course on Coursera, going for a certification in Deep Learning: https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning

This repo will serve as a backup for python projects for deep learning. Will not be uploading ALL of my notes here, as I don't want to violate Coursera's TOS
